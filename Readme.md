# Email Unsubscriber

It is really hard to unsubscribe from Gmail because we might have many emails. The aim of this project is to easily provide way to unsubscribe email by creating your own app and run the code from opensource.
There are many tools already built but you might be concerned about the  privacy because this process requires you to give access to your inbox.

With this project everything is owned by your local machine i.e 

* You will use your created google app
* You will use your own email token
* Your data will be saved in local database postgres



## Things to do
- Create documentation on how to use this project
- Write test
